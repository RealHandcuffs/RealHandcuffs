If you still want to install manually, the following instructions describes the manual installation steps.
The package contains multiple folders. You will need to COPY the contents of several of these folders.
The contents of each copied folder must be copied into your /Fallout 4/Data folder.

0_Common
  The contents of this folder are always required. COPY the contents of this folder.

1_Standard
2_Lite
  Only the contents of one folder are required. Never copy the contents of both folders!
  - To install Standard Edition (recommended), COPY the contents of 1_Standard.
  - To install Lite Edition (less changes to persistent objects), COPY the contents of 2_Lite.

3_Convert
  Contains plugins for conversion recipies. Only required if you install Lite Edition, and only one plugin is required.
  - If you are installing Standard Edition, DO NOT COPY anything.
  - If you are installing Lite Edition, choose a single plugin and COPY it:
     - The plugins with _CS in the name allow converting at the Chemistry Station, under the "Utility" category.
     - The plugins with _AWKCR in the name allow converting at the AWKCR Armorsmith Workbench, under the "Hands - Accessories" category.
     - The plugins with _DD  in the name allow converting at the Devious Devices Restraints Workbench, under the "Gloves & Wristcuffs" category.
     - So for example, RealHandcuffs_Convert_CS_AWKCR.esp contains conversion recipies for Chemistry Station ("_CS") and Armorsmith Workbench ("_AWKCR").
